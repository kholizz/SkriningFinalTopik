4,Rosiello et al. (2017),Online Article,Automatic Text Summarization Overview,"Automatic text summarization aims to reduce a document into a shorter version while preserving the most important information. Extractive summarization selects important sentences from the original text. Recent approaches utilize word embeddings to capture semantic similarity between words and sentences."
5,Rosiello et al. (2017),Research Blog,Semantic Centroid in Summarization,"Centroid-based summarization represents documents using vector representations. Word embeddings improve traditional TF-IDF by capturing semantic relationships. Sentences close to the semantic centroid are selected as summaries, improving coherence and relevance."
6,Rosiello et al. (2017),Academic Notes,Word Embeddings for Summarization,"Word embeddings allow semantic comparison between sentences beyond surface word matching.
